Spent a long time on the road going nowhere
Time of my life but it felt like a nightmare
Wondering who am I? Who am I?
Couldn't even recognize my own eyes, yeah
Hard to find the truth when you know that it ain't there

See, they're talking about me, chasing dreams and I caught 'em
And everything that I wanted I had to let go
